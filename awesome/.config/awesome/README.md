# My supersimple awesome config

This is basically the default config with a minimal theme (doom) and three widgets (volume and battery and calendar) taken from [deficient](https://github.com/deficient). For a fully functional desktop system, remember to install the following programs too:

- picom (compositor effects)
- feh (img viewer and wallpaper setter)
- networkmanager (for network-manager-applet)
- blueman (for blueman-applet)
- xorg-xrdb (load Xresources)
- xorg-xmodmap (run Xmodmap)
- xsettingsd (xsettings deamon)


## Other usefull GUI programs

- pavucontrol (pulsaudio volume control)
- lxappearence (gtk theme switcher)
- arandr (xrandr interface)
- xarchiver (archive manager)
- pcmanfm (file manager)
- geany (text editor)
