- picom (compositor effects)
- feh (img viewer and wallpaper setter)
- networkmanager (for network-manager-applet)
- blueman (for blueman-applet)
- xorg-xrdb (load Xresources)
- xorg-xmodmap (run Xmodmap)
- xsettingsd (xsettings deamon)


## Other usefull programs

- pavucontrol (pulsaudio gui volume control)
- lxappearence (gtk gui theme switcher)
- arandr (gui xrandr)
- pcmanfm (gui file manager)
- geany (gui editor)
