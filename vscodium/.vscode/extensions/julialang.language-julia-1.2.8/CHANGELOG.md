### Changed
* Inline evaluation now adds the evaluated code to the REPL history *if* the `julia.codeInREPL` options is set ([#1754](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1754)).
* The extension now watches the global Manifest as well as Manifests in the workspace for changes and prompts the LS to re-index accordingly ([#1756](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/pull/1756)).

### Fixed
