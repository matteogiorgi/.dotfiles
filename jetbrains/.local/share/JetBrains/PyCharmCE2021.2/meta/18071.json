{"id":18071,"xmlId":"TabSwitch","name":"TabSwitch","description":"Open files/tabs switcher to quickly switch between tabs with less keystrokes than Recent Files. Open files are selected from a list in most recently used order, similarly to Alt+Tab in Windows or Ctrl-Tab in Opera. By default the action is mapped to Alt+A, but another popular assignment is CMD+E.\n<br />\n<br /> Thanks to Timur Zambalayev for the original plugin, Martin Fuhrer for a major contribution in the form of a rewrite and Mark Scott for patching a bug.
